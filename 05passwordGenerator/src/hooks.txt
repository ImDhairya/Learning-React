what will the use of each hook is ? (for your own reference for future projects)

1) useState => used to add const [length, setLength] = useState('5');

this is used so we can declare variables 

2) useCallback => used to memorized version of callback only changes if one of the dependencies have changed, we have used it in passwordGenerator function. 

  const passwordGenerator = useCallback(() => {
    let pass = "";
    let str = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    if (numberAllowed) str += "0123456789";
    if (charAllowed) str += "!@#$%^&*-_+=[]{}~`";

    for (let i = 1; i <= length; i++) {
      let char = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length + 1);

      pass += str.charAt(char);
    }

    setPassword(pass);
  }, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, setPassword]);


3) useEffect => this is used to see the dom change lets say we make a counter and it changes its value then we need to show it to the do aswell then we will use this to actually change the value in website.

4) useRef => This creates mutable object wiht .current property initialized to passed argument
