This is for you to understand the begining of react Router that we are using and what we find so difficult to understand, here's simplified understanding for you.

React router is nothing but an exact same app that you are making with header, footer, home page in your app.jsx alright. 

In react router we do not import app.jsx file in our sourcer supreme index.html file

so what do we do instead??

we will do this ->  
  1) we will remove <App /> from index.html file
  2) we will instead make this 
  # <RouterProvider router = {router} /> #
  in our index.html file replacing <App />. 
  3) and what is that router you may ask???
   it is this.




  4) Creating an Layout.jsx file with this view
